# Uprate Technologies
A collection of documents that may be used as a framework to run any successful software development company.

## Why Open-Source Our Operational Documents?
To answer this you must first understand who we are and what our culture as a company is all about.

### Our Culture
It is the people in an organisation that determine how successful that organisation will be, that is why we take great care in not only living our mission in order to achieve our vision but without compromising our work ethics.

#### Tagline
**Value Driven Innovation:** It means that we are a result driven people, we don't like to innovate blindly without knowing what impact our changes have had to the end results. We strongly believe that if it can't be measured, it can't be improved.

#### Slogan
A software solution for every idea.

#### Mission
To deliver leading software solutions to all the boundary pushing innovators.

#### Vision
To completely remove the technical challenges from the software product development industry, so that all innovative software products may be affordably pursued by anyone with passion and an idea.

#### Ethics
##### We are scientists
We have strong and confident opinions but we hold them weakly. We form theories and put them to the test with experiments. But we keep an open mind and allow conclusive data to sway our opinions.

##### We are honest
We are honest not just with ourselves but with each other. We take constructive criticism in our stride and we always criticise constructively. We take responsibility for our mistakes and use them to learn and grow our abilities.

##### We are different
We are eccentric, weird and wacky misfits that overdo everything, including partying. We have fun pushing the boundaries of innovation. We keep our culture lean and agile, ready to adapt and change to rise above any challenge that life may throw at us.

##### We are people
We spend time with our families to rest and recharge. We understand that true life wealth is finding a balance between work, family and play. We have work, we have hobbies, we have responsibilities, we have lives, we are people.
